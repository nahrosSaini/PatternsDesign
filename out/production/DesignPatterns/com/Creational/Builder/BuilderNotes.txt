/*

1. Handles complex constructors
2. Large number of parameters
3. Immutability

Examples :
    ->StringBuilder
    ->DocumentBuilder
    ->Locale.Builder

PITFALLS :

1. Immutable
2. Inner static class
3. Designed first
4. Complexity


Contrast :

       BUILDER                                  PROTOTYPE

1. Handle complex constructors      1. Implemented around a clone
2. No interface required            2. Avoids calling complex constructors
3. Can be a separate class          3. Difficult to implement in legacy code
4. Woks with legacy code

Summary :

1. Creative way to deal with complexity
2. Easy to implement
3. Few drawbacks
4. Can refactor in with separate class
