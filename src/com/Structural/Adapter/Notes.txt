CONCEPTS :

1. Plug adaptor
2. Convert interface to another interface
3. Legacy
4. Translates request
5. Client, Adaptor, Adaptee

EXAMPLES :
- > Arrays -> Lists
- > Streams

DESIGN  :

1. Client Centric
2. Integrate new with Old
3. Interface, but not required
4. Adaptee can be the implementation


PITFALLS :

Not a lot
Don't complicate
Multiple Adaptor


CONTRAST :


    ADAPTER                                              BRIDGE
1. Works after code is designed.                1. Designed Upfront.
2. Legacy.                                      2. Abstraction and implementation vary.
3. Retrofitted.                                 3.Built in advance
4. Provides different Interface.                4. Both adapt multiple systems
