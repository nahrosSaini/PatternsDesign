/*

CONCEPT :

1. Eliminate conditional statements
2. Behaviour encapsulated in classes
3. Difficult to add new strategies
4. Client aware of strategies
5. Client choose strategy

EXAMPLES :

java.util.Comparator

DESIGN :

1. Abstract base class
2. Concrete class per Strategy
3. Removes if/else conditionals
4. Strategies are independent

PITFALLS :

1. Client should be aware of the strategy
2. Increased number of classes


CONTRAST :

    STATE                                      STRATEGY

1. Interface Based                      1. Interface Based.
2. One know the next state.             2. Algorithms are independent
3. Class per State.                     3. Class per Algorithm
