/*

CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY

1.Decouple of sender and receiver
2.Receiver contains reference to next receiver
3.Promotes loose coupling
4.No Handler-OK

EXAMPLES :

 -> java.util.logging.Logger#log()
 -> javax.servlet.filter#doFilter()

CONCEPTS :

1. Chain of Receiver objects
2. Handler is interface based
3. ConcreteHandler for each implementation
4. Each handler has a reference to the next
5. Handler,ConcreteHandler


PITFALLS :

Handling/Handler guarantee
Runtime configuration risk
Chain length/performance issues

CONTRAST :

CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY              COMMAND

1.Handler is unique.             1. Command also unique
2.Successor                      2. Encapsulate function
3.Can utilize the Command        3. Reversible or Trackable in nature
