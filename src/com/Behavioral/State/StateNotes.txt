/*

CONCEPT:

Localize state behaviour
State Object
Separates what from where
OCP

EXAMPLES  :

not examples in java
1. JSF
2. ITERATOR
3. NONE!

DESIGN :

Abstract class/Interface
Class based
Context unaware
Context ,state ,ConcreteState

PITFALLS:

You must know all states of your application
you end up with more classes
keep logic out of context
State change is

CONTRAST :

    STATE                                      STRATEGY

1. Interface Based                      1. Interface Based.
2. One know the next state.             2. Algorithms are independent
3. Class per State.                     3 . Class per Algorithm
