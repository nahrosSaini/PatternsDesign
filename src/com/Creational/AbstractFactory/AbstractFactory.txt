Factory of factories  : AbstractFactory

Examples  :

->DocumentBuilder
->Frameworks

DESIGN:

1. Group of factories together
2. Factory is responsible for lifecycle
3. Common interface
4. Concrete classes
5. Parameterized create method
6. Composition

PITFALLS:

1. Complexity (difficult of all Creational design patterns)
2. Runtime switch
3. pattern with in a Pattern
4. Problem specific

SUMMARY :

1. Group of similar factories
2. Complex
3. Heavy Abstraction
4. Framework pattern
